# What is an LLM? Educational Website

## Project Description
This is a concise, single-page educational website designed to introduce newcomers to the fundamentals of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It covers:

- **Core Concepts**: What LLMs are, how they’re trained on vast text corpora, and the basics of neural network architectures (transformers).
- **Key Use Cases**: Real-world applications such as chatbots, content generation, summarization, translation, and sentiment analysis.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Common risks like bias, misinformation, and privacy implications, along with best practices for responsible use.
- **Interactive Learning**: Hands-on elements including a toggleable comparison table of popular models, random trivia alerts, and theme switching to keep learners engaged.
- **Responsive & Accessible Design**: Built with mobile-first styling and semantic HTML to ensure readability and usability across devices.

## Special Features
- Interactive comparison table of popular LLMs (toggle show/hide)
- Trivia/fun facts section with random fact alerts
- Dark/Light theme switcher for user preference
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile viewing
